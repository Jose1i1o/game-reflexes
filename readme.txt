*************************
*
* We work on individual branches. Before doing push, we consult our PM. 
* 
* We use BEM methodology
* Example: <nav class="tag--element__property"></nav>
* 
* We donÂ´t use ids for css classes
* IDs are only used for javascript
* 
* We are using only one css & one html --> We are using the template.
* Use flex not grid.
* 
* All class and id names in kebab-case
* Body-Section(inside the template)-Article-div-

* HOW TO PLAY THE GAME
*
*************************
* 
* A sample image is shown and the user has to click its match. There is no time limit to do it.
* 
* We will count the time within the start of the game and the end of the game.
* 
* We will show the user rank at the initial page.
